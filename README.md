# Frolic-WebChat
deploying my webchat project

Successfully deployed at https://frolic-webchat.onrender.com/ ( sleeps without activity ) 
issue with state not persisting? Couldn't fix it, tech support couldn't help much. After this I took everything 
and made a project and deployed on Heroku, solved more problems and learned alot and had no
issue with state persisting haha 

This project works perfectly when ran on local and can communicate live between two browser tabs or two systems running on local
